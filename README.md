## 💡 Project Summary

This website is a **personal portfolio project** that I created to improve my front-end skills and demonstrate my knowledge of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It has a simple and clean design focused on structure, responsiveness, and readability — a perfect example of how I apply what I’ve learned.

The original design was **taken from a free HTML template website** I found online.  
I used it as a starting point to study layout and styling, then **modified and improved** the structure, visuals, and content to make it **my own version**.  
Every section, color, and detail has been adjusted by me to better reflect my personal work and creativity.

The main goal of this project is to show my **initiative, technical understanding, and motivation** to learn and build something on my own — as part of my portfolio for the **Vilnius University (Software Engineering)** application.
